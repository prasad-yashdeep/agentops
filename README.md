# 🔧 AgentOps — Self-Healing DevOps Agent

> **AI-powered incident detection, diagnosis, and auto-fix with collaborative human-in-the-loop.**

AgentOps monitors a live production e-commerce application, detects failures in real time, uses Claude AI to diagnose root causes and generate fixes, validates safety through White Circle AI, and auto-deploys fixes when confidence is high — or escalates to the team for approval when the risk is too great.

Built in 5 hours at the **Iterate x CBS AI Club Hackathon** at Columbia Business School.

### Dashboard — Real-Time Incident Timeline
Configuration error detected as **BLOCKER** at 95% confidence. Claude AI identifies the exact root cause, generates a targeted fix with diff, and White Circle AI validates safety — all in under 15 seconds.

![Dashboard - Config Error Detection](docs/images/dashboard-config-error.png)

### Auto-Fix in Action
Bug injected → Claude diagnoses a NameError at handler.py line 54 → White Circle validates the fix → auto-deployed at 95% confidence without human intervention. Full timeline from detection to resolution.

![Auto-Fix Timeline](docs/images/autofix-timeline.jpg)

### Live API Viewer
Real-time view of the e-commerce app running inside the Blaxel sandbox. Products, orders, analytics, and users — all live. Status indicator shows current health + active incidents.

![Live API Viewer](docs/images/live-api-viewer.png)

### E-Commerce Shop
Full storefront with product catalog, cart management, and checkout — orders flow through to the live API in real time.

### Blaxel Sandbox
The target e-commerce app runs inside a real Blaxel persistent sandbox (`agentops-ecom`). 373+ API calls, 0% error rate, 7% resource usage.

## 🎯 The Problem

Production incidents are stressful, time-consuming, and often happen at the worst times. Engineers scramble to diagnose issues, worry about making things worse with a fix, and lack visibility into what's happening across the team. Traditional monitoring tools alert you — but they don't *fix* anything.

## 💡 Our Solution

AgentOps is a **self-healing DevOps agent** that:
1. **Detects** failures via continuous health monitoring (every 5s)
2. **Diagnoses** root causes using Claude AI with full traceback analysis
3. **Generates** targeted fixes with code diffs and GitHub deep links
4. **Validates** fix safety through White Circle AI guardrails
5. **Auto-deploys** when confidence > 85% and severity is non-critical
6. **Escalates** to the team with role-based approval for critical/blocker issues
7. **Learns** from human decisions to improve future confidence scoring

All of this happens on a **real running application** in a **real Blaxel sandbox** — not a simulation.

### How It Works

1. **Health Monitor** polls the target app every 5 seconds via the Blaxel sandbox
2. On failure, the **Agent Core** captures error logs, tracebacks, and source code context
3. **Claude AI** analyzes everything and returns: root cause, affected file + line, fix diff, confidence score, and plain-English explanation
4. **White Circle AI** validates the proposed fix against safety policies (no destructive commands, no credential exposure, no data loss)
5. Based on confidence + severity, the agent either **auto-deploys** or **escalates** to the team via WebSocket
6. Team members approve/reject through the dashboard with **role-based permissions**
7. The **Learning System** records every decision to adjust future confidence scores

### Confidence-Based Escalation

| Confidence | Severity | Action |
|---|---|---|
| **≥ 85%** | Medium/Low | 🤖 **Auto-fix** — deployed without human approval |
| **≥ 85%** | Blocker | 🔒 **Team Lead approval required** — too risky for auto |
| **50-85%** | Any | 👥 **Human review** — team decides |
| **< 50%** | Any | ⚠️ **Escalate** — needs expert investigation |

### Confidence Scoring

```
Base (0.50)
  + Error category match     (+0.10)
  + File identified           (+0.05)
  + Line number found         (+0.05)
  + Sandbox test passed       (+0.15)
  + Fix applied successfully  (+0.05)
  + Safety check passed       (+0.10)
  + Safety score bonus        (+0.10)
  + Claude AI reasoning       (+0.15)  ← LLM trust boost
  + Learning adjustment       (±0.20)  ← from past human decisions
  − Severity penalty          (varies)
```
